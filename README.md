# Mini DOM Projects

This repository contains five mini DOM projects that demonstrate basic JavaScript and DOM manipulation skills. Each project is built using `.addEventListener` and `.querySelector` to handle events and interact with the page elements. Each project folder includes three files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `index.js`.

## Projects Overview

1. **Adding & Removing Friends (Facebook-like Feature)**  
   Allows adding and removing friends with the same button, similar to Facebook's functionality.

2. **Instagram-like Button**  
   A button that toggles between a filled and unfilled heart, mimicking Instagram's like button.

3. **Custom Cursor**  
   A custom cursor that follows the mouse movement across the screen for a unique user interaction experience.

4. **Image Hovering Effect**  
   An image hover effect that changes the position and opacity of the image based on mouse movement and hover.

5. **Insta Story Feature**  
   A feature where users' profile pictures act as story circles, and clicking them displays their story in full-screen mode for a few seconds.
